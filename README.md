# Can You Catch Them All?
A Pokemon Themed Project by an Aspiring Pokemon Trainer: Anna Vu
<br>
<br>

Encountered a new Pokemon? Make sure to catch it so you can expand your Pokedex! Though handfuls of Pokemon are *pretty* easy to secure, there's a wide range of difficulty. You won't know their level of difficulty to catch unless you try, but that can get expensive quick. Pokeballs and its variants aren't free. 

<br>

If you knew how easy or hard it was to catch a Pokemon, you could take the right approaches. You don't want to waste time for the easier ones, and you want to come prepared for the harder ones. I am going to use classification machine learning algorithms to see if it can predict, on a scale, of how difficult they will be based on their features.

### A. Project Overview
---

#### 1. Project Description

Some Pokemon are easier to catch than others, but before you try to catch one...wouldn't it be nice to know their catch rate? Hang onto your Pokeballs! In this project, I will be working with a Pokemon dataset to predict categorical catch rates of Pokemon. Catch rates of pokemon range from 3 (low catch rate, the hardest to catch) to 255 (high catch rate, the easiest). I'm going to be binning the catch rates into 5 categories:
 - 1.) 1 are the extremely hard ones
 - 2.) 2 are the hard ones
 - 3.) 3 are the mid-difficulty ones
 - 4.) 4 are the easy ones
 - 5.) 5 is the easiest

These categories are found under the simplified_catch_rate column. This allows me to be able to use classification for 5 groups. Bear in mind that Pokemon are super diverse, even within these 5 bins is a wide range of features. However, I should be able to find some relationships and patterns. 

#### 2. Project Deliverables

### B. Project Summary
---

#### 1. Goals

My goal is to predict categorical catch rates of Pokemon based on some of their features. My classification model should be able to beat the baseline (assuming every Pokemon has the same mode catch rate category.) I'm hoping to find some meaningful relationships between the features that determine catch rate. 

#### 2. Hypothesis

I believe a number of things determine the general catchability of a Pokemon. Putting level aside, I believe that type, battle statistics, kinds of abilities, and size would determine if a Pokemon would be easier or harder to catch. 

#### 3. Findings & Next Steps

With some exploration with how some of the features correlated to each other (plus a failed attempt to find meaningful clusters), and SelectKBest feature engineering, I was able to find that total points was the biggest driver to the difficulty level of catching a Pokemon. Total Points seems to be directly related to stats like attack, defense, speed, and health points. This was a strong factor to determine catchability, but it was not the end-all. There were Pokemon with top-tier total points that actually had a very high catch rate.

The next phase is to further create new features from the original data, and perhaps separate the different catch rates further more. I believe my model would perform better with a larger scale of catch rates. Due to the constraint of time (and maybe my lack of knowledge of Pokemon), I categorized them based on how I felt was appropriate, but to categorize such a wide range of catch rates may have affected my model's ability to accurately predict which subgroup they belonged in (especially the easier ones). 
<br>

My decision tree model performed on unseen data with 71.29% accuracy. It did really well at predicting catch rates for those with either a 1 or 2 (the difficult) for their catchability, but with the two easiest subgroups---it had a really hard time distinguishing. I guess we better take this to Professor Oak's lab and look further into those easier Pokemon to see if we should categorize them in the same level of difficulty, or find features that will distinguish them.

### C. Data Context
---

#### 1. About the Pokedex Data

This Pokedex.csv was acquired from [Mario Tormo's Complete Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420) (at the time, it was the csv that was updated May 2020). It has over a thousand entries of Generation 1-8 Pokemon, complete with their names, stats, breeding, gender, types, what kinds of attacks they are affected by or not affected by, and more! I took some of the columns and enumerated them so that they could be used by the model. None of the the new features I made from object columns were strongly correlated, so I didn't end up using them for this goal. However, I'm sure whenever I can make other predictions, I will put them to use.
